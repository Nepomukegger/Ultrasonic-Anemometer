# Ultrasonic Anemometer

It is planned to create an ultrasonic anemometer, wind speed and direction measuring device with 4 ultrasonic sensors and to implement its programming. The required mathematical formulas can be found on the homepage [Link].

The idea is to determine the wind based on the latency. In other words, the time it takes for the sound to travel from one side of the structure to the other is measured. To get a more accurate measurement, the measurement is carried out in 2 directions perpendicular to each other, furthermore the measurement is always carried out twice in opposite directions to be able to determine a more accurate vector that represents the speed.

The whole thing is still to be written down in a specification sheet, further notes will follow, which should help to realize this project.
