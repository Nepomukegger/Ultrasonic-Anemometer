# Ultrasonic Anemometer

The project aims to create an ultrasonic anemometer, a device for measuring wind speed and direction using four ultrasonic sensors, along with implementing its programming. The documentation at [DL1GLH](https://www.dl1glh.de/ultraschall-anemometer.html) was very helpful in providing an overview and detailed information on how ultrasonic anemometers work.

The concept is to measure wind speed based on the latency of sound waves. Specifically, the time it takes for sound to travel from one side of the structure to the other is recorded. To achieve more accurate measurements, the device performs measurements in two perpendicular directions. Furthermore, measurements are taken in both directions for each axis, enabling a more accurate calculation of the wind speed vector by compensating for potential errors and variations..

A specification sheet is planned to be written, and further notes will follow to support the realization of this project.
